Tips for problem solving because I'm stupid.

- Write down patterns or rules you discover while solving
problems. Use Anki? I don't know if that's the best approach.

- Write down, understand and memorise useful math formulae used in
problems. Use Anki to help you remember.

- If you have any minor problem in understanding the problem just
draw everything somewhere.

- Read instructions, hints and examples carefully. Every bit of
information helps getting a better solution.

- Quickly mentally scan data structures to see if any of them fits
perfectly.

- Try to visualise the underlying properties of your input. If you
understand your data, half of the problem is solved.

- Practice everyday. Repeat implementations until it's wired in your
brain.
